# hello-world
My very first web learning thingy. 
I like hikes, the sun, bike rides to the library, and learning all the things. I have way too many ideas and know way too much about how expensive it is to hire a web designer. Non-location specific work is my favorite work because non-location specific life is my favorite life. 
I also really enjoy tacos.
